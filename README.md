## Introduction 
  The site contained herewithin is a simple HTML page I am working on (2/11/2019) as the homepage default across my home network or any satellite thereof that sometimes venture into the wide world of networking. Ideally, these would be hosted locally for each machine with a specific port number there by assigned based on some random number generator that would simplify the set up but as it stands I have used it in two ways:
  1. Hosting on local server and pointing internal browsers to that internal IP address (not useful if not home) 
  2. Locally hosting on each machine (updating can be a hassle or a fun game to encourage neuralplasticity. 
  
  
 ## Features
 
 - Each Group of Bookmarks Is Intended to Expedite the Use of the Browser Without the Distractions 
 
 - No Cumbersome effects, annoying JS to prevent tabbing or any unneeded fuel from the resource guzzling modern web browsers. 
 
 - Platform agnostic x100000 - No Operating System or even Browser Requirements. Microsoft is preparing to monkey wrench this I am sure but for now it even works on Edge!(If you use pre-IE, I don't care about your UX since you clearly don't)
