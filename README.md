# startpage

A custom homepage and new tab page for Firefox on Linux that aggregates the links I like having handy and minimizes distractions by stripping away any reccomended clikbait Mozilla would spam my browser with.

## Technologies Utilized
- HTML - providing the overall structure the site uses
- CSS - providing the aesthetics, which are tuned to my preferences towards dark interfaces and thick fonts
- JS - providing the application logic, functions enabling variable searches and pop-over menus for each link category.

### Local Only Deployment
Due to my needs and the nature of the application logic, this site **will not run remotely** and I have not yet found time to rewrite it to do soom (*coming soon*). Thus if you want to test it for yourself, you will need to download it locally and open it with your browser.
