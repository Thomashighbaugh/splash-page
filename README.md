# Electric Tantra Splash Page

> The second incarnation of my homepage. Forked from nightTabs and modified 

## Install
To modify the page for your needs:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/splash=page
cd splash-page/
npm install
# Perform your modifications with your favorite text editor
# Use prettier to reformat the code you modify
```

## Development 

If you are modifying the source code and would like to test your changes, simply execute the file _index.html_ in your browser. 


## To Add Bookmarks
If you are not planning on clearing your browser data (or like my bookmarks) then you can _ignore this section_ and just add bookmarks using the dialog on the live page

To add new default bookmarks 
- Go to bookmarks.js 
- Look for the following variable
```javascript
var bookmarks = (function(){
    var all = [
```
- Inside of that, use the template below to add a new bookmark
---
### Bookmark Template 
```javascript
   {
      display: "icon",
      letter: "EX",
      icon: {
        name: "code",
        prefix: "fas",
        label: "Example"
      }, 
       name: "Example",
      url: "http://whatever.url",
      accent: {
        override: false,
        color: {
          r: null,
          g: null,
          b: null
        }
      },
```
#### Template Components
- display - either icon or letter. Determines if the Bookmark uses a font 
awesome icon or the letters in the letter variable
- letter - Which letters are used in cases which display = letter
- icon - specifies what icon to use
    - name - name of the icon to use. Look up icons on [font awesome's website](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free), but **you must use the exact name of the icon**
    - prefix - tells the program where to look for the icon. On font awesome's website this is indicated by the three letter prefix as in the fas in `<i class="fas fa-fan"></i>` which must be enter here
        - fab - these are generally brand icons, most of what you will use
        for larger sites. 
        - fas - icons using a solid style 
        - far - icons using a regular style 
        - fal - uses light style  
   - label - the icon's label, I generally use the same label as the name
- name: the name of the bookmark as it displays on the page
- url - the url the bookmark will lead to, also displays if the mouse hovers over the bookmark 
- accent - generally off, but can be used to give specific bookmarks a color
    - override - set to true if you want to change the color
        - color - set the components to the RGB style you want the icon color to be or if _override_ is false keep these at null
