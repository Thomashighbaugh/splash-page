## Introduction
This repository contains the source code of my personal homepage, available [here](https://electric-tantra-splash-page.netlify.com/). Inspired by posts on the r/startpages subreddit, I decided to make my own version (which due to my distaste with the reddit community, I have no intention of posting on Reddit). The site itself is a dashboard which contains a series of links I find useful in the daily operation of my freelancing business and general computing needs. It is not an expansive collection of my bookmarks, but merely the bookmarks that I am most likely to want immediate access to when opening my browser. If your needs are different, feel free to fork the repository and develop your own version!

## Features 
This site features a few nifty little additions on top of the links provided in the typical **E L E C T R I C   T A N T R A** style such as:
    
    - A clock that fetches the local time and displays it on the top of the screen 
    - A search feature that is activated with a push of the spacebar 
    - My custom logo (I designed myself)
## Languages 

- ### HTML5 
    For markup/layout of the site and including some of the functionality to be passed on to javascript. As with all sites, it is also the host of the ID and Class designations used in the JS and CSS for styling and functionality purposes

- ### CSS3 
    Used to stylize the site. In comparison to other **E L E C T R I C   T A N T R A** sites, this one was designed to be rather lean on the CSS in favor of focusing more on the advanced functionality of the site. This was due to the site mainly being intended for internal use (though still posted for the benefit of the open source community and prospective clients or employers) 

- ### Vanilla JS 
     Using mostly updated syntax, this site derives its functionality from the Javascript that is included in this source code. Specific attention was paid to labeling the portions of the source code so anyone else looking at it later would be aware of what portion is performing what function (typically overlooked by other developers). 
     
## Electric Tantra Style 
 
  The style that this site uses is part of a personal taste-turned-paradigm called the Electric Tantra that uses a Neon Noir based style to flavor my personal web development efforts. The aesthetics compliment the function of the site and create a seamless blending of function, ease of use and street smart design based on the latest emerging trends in high art and musical aesthetics. Characteristics of the style (and the functionality) are listed below  
    - Dark UI - makes looking at the screen in low light conditions easier 
    - Mobile Optimized - makes the site available on a variety of devices and for multiple use cases (with reduced functionality due to lack of a physical keyboard) 
    - Neon Colors - reduce the darkness of the site's Dark UI and help to prevent the UI from appearing stale 
    - Monospaced Fonts - prevent text from being rendered in hard to read spacing
